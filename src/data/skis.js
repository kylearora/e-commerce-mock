    "description": "Little brother to the Enforcer 100 in width only, the Nordica Enforcer 93 Skis certainly wowed the ski world last season, amassing awards left and right thanks to its no holds barred approach to skiing anything in its path. The Enforcer 93 combines a soft-snow happy hammerhead nose with a rocker profile that begs to lay trenches. Stacked with Nordica s burly Energy 2 Titanal construction, this metal and wood cored charger has no speed limit - click in and enjoy the ride.",

    "description": "For the jib-minded all-mountain skier, Line offers up the Blend for another trip around the sun. Featuring an updated topsheet and base, this park and all-mountain cruiser remains otherwise unchanged -- and believe us, that's a good thing! Gone are the days of having park-specific skis: Grease up those surface swaps, drop your tips on those switch lip hits, and maybe even ski a couple of upper mountain laps before taking on super-illusives. Thanks to the helping hand of tip rocker, early taper, and fluid flex, the Line Skis Blend Skis are the stable platform you need to air things out up top with your older brother in the morning only to blast park laps with the homies in the afternoon -- all without having to switch skis.",

    "description": "A crowd favorite at evo, the Black Crows Atris Skis sold out in less than a month last season... The 108 mm waist is perfect for a western daily driver, and the ski is nimble and incredibly lively while retaining enough stability to land big hits and rail at speed. If you're looking for a playful all-rounder that doesn't wimp out when pushed hard, you owe it to yourself to put the Black Crows Atris on your short list of contenders.",
